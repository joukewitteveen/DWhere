This version was tested on a Samsung GT-B2710

Permanent permission to send text messages and poll the location can be
set using TkFileExplorer by removing:
    AppEx/User/Java/Games/DWhere/appdb/settings.bin

Keypad auto-locking needs to be disabled:
    Menu -> Settings -> Phone -> Keypad auto-lock -> Off

In order to still lock the keypad, the program must be able to run in
the background. Enable this by dialing *#7092463*#:
    Module Settings -> Java -> VM Settings -> MVM Settings ->
      MVM user End Key Option -> Hide only

Recipients and locks can be specified as a comma and/or space separated
list. An editor pops up when you press and hold the `#' key while in a
text field.
