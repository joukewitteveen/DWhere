This version was tested on a Samsung GT-B2710

Keypad auto-locking needs to be disabled:
    Menu -> Settings -> Phone -> Keypad auto-lock -> Off

In order to still lock the keypad, the program must be able to run in
the background. Enable this by dialing *#7092463*#:
    Module Settings -> Java -> VM Settings -> MVM Settings ->
      MVM user End Key Option -> Hide only

Recipients and locks can be specified as a comma and/or space separated
list. An editor pops up when you press and hold the `#' key while in a
text field.
